         <h1>Are You  Ready</h1>
            	             
            <p>Are you ready for February? It is the biggest month for sneakers out of the entire year – it’s when brands come forward with some of the year’s very best, and when stores report the highest numbers in sales. The next four weeks or so promise some very big things, and here at Sneaker News, we have narrowed it down to a select number of headlines and predictions that should direct you down the right path.
	            
	            
	            We’ve covered a wide array of topics that you’re probably most interested in, touching on the Air Jordan XX9, random restocks at the new Flight 23, the Kobe 9, and much more. Continue reading for a look at all you need to know for this month, and stay tuned for the latest in release dates, info, and other previews of the most important footwear out there.
            </p>
           
              <p>If you are a sneaker head with hundreds of dollars in disposable income laying around or a sneaker head that simply dreams of being in a sneaker heaven- do yourself a favor and visit!
With that said, if your last pair of sneakers were purchased at the Nike Outlet on sale for $29.99 and those were the 1st pair of sneakers you've purchased in the last 5 years, you should probably skip this excursion, though  even I was entertained to see the Nike "back to the future" sneakers on display for a "reasonable" price of $7,000.
      </p> 
               <p>Heat Check is a sneakerheads paradise! The walls are filled from top to bottom, literally, with the latest and rarest shoes in the shoe game. Definitely check out this spot if you're looking for a fresh pair of kicks! Sneaker obsession is a part of our culture and it's here to stay.  I am, have always been, and will always be a sneaker head.  Air Jordans aren't just basketball shoes.  They are a connection to our past.  They remind us of what it was like to have that gleeful, innocent joy to put on a pair of sneakers and think you could actually fly.  Air Max 1s aren't just comfortable shoes.  They are a reminder that simplicity and beauty often go hand in hand.  Nike Dunks aren't just shoes to skate and bike in.  They remind us that your feet can indeed become works of art.

Heat Check is every sneakerhead's dream.  Not only is it a place where you can find that sneaker that you missed out on, but it also serves as a museum in many ways.  The premium sneakers in the back are placed behind a strong glass casing, and on any day at any time, you can see young and old sneaker lovers stare in awe and amazement.  Having almost every major sneaker made in the last ten years in one place serves as a great reminder to sneaker lovers why we love this strange, bizarre, and nerdy word.  

You must be warned a trip to Heat Check is quite an experience. Some of the prices will shock you. We've had someone spend $3000 on one pair of Nike Yeezys.  True story.  I'm still on the fence as to whether I should applaud the man for his balling nature.  We are extremely busy.  And you'll find yourself spending much more on sneakers than you anticipated.  But the joy of getting that sneaker that you will love and cherish can be matched by very few things in life.

 The selection is extensive and pricey.  But the shoes are oh so beautiful.  If you love sneakers or know someone that does, go to Heat Check asap.  And if you don't love sneakers, you should go anyways and be shocked by this strange world that sneakerheads inhabit.  A world where a pair of sneakers can be $3000.  A world where sneakers are more important than almost everything else in life.  A world where people are united by one common love.

               <p>If you're an avid shoe collector or just looking for a comfortable running shoe look no further. This place has the largest collection of shoes from all times (original & retros)... given the fact if you're ready to spend! I've bought shoes from them online in the past but seeing the store in-person is impressive, kid in a candy store affect.
